    PyMaxflow is a Python library for graph construction and
    maxflow computation (commonly known as `graph cuts`). The
    core of this library is the C++ implementation by
    Vladimir Kolmogorov, which can be downloaded from his
    `homepage <http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/V.Kolmogorov/>`_.
    Besides the wrapper to the C++ library, PyMaxflow offers

    * NumPy integration, 
    * methods for the construction of common graph
      layouts in computer vision and graphics,
    * implementation of algorithms for fast energy
      minimization which use the `maxflow` method:
      the alpha-beta-swap and the alpha-expansion.
